- Survey musicians to find out what people want and what their current experience is
  - hangups?
  - experience of venues?
  - other resources wanted?
  - peoples' perceptions of how things are vs. how things actually are

- Looking to other industries for cues? (film)

- Potential pitfalls of organizing and how to get ahead

- What unites us, how are we different, what are our common and differing needs?
  - genre, location, notoriety, socio-economic status, race, gender, age, accessibility
  - musician, engineer, booking agent, lead vs side person, solo vs band vs DJ

- What resources already exist/who is already doing the work?

Recognizing my role.  I want to have my say, but I'm not sure how much of a capacity I have for organizing.  

What I want to see:

- Better pay for musicians all around
- Less alcohol centric shows
- Earlier shows
- All Agse shows
- More creative booking (cross genre, resrouces toward helping w/ transportation)
- Funding to help w/ merch, touring
- Ear health / sound level standardization 
- Better resources for DIY venues to promote safety (first aid kits, training, etc)
- Sliding scale ticket prices to make shows accessible but still be able to pay the artist
